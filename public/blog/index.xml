Unlimited is a great amount when it comes to amusement park rides or data you are allowed to use. But unlimited can go from fun to overwhelming when you’re trying to make definitive choices on how to facilitate a group.
For my first ten years facilitating, I often made choices based on the type of interaction style I thought the group needed.

Hello Wet Erase.</title><link>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/testing-and-changing-directions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/testing-and-changing-directions/</guid><description>For months, our plan was for the cards to be dry erase. This was one of the requirements for our manufacturer. But it turns out wet erase (think overhead projectors) is the way to go. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
It&amp;rsquo;s important to be able to stack the cards and not Etch-a-Sketch all of your plans.
With dry erase markers, it turns out (and is obvious now, in hindsight) the friction of stacking a card on top of another is enough to erase whatever you&amp;rsquo;ve written on it.</description></item><item><title>Changing the Game</title><link>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/changing-the-game/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/changing-the-game/</guid><description>As a facilitator I pride myself on being able to tap into and respond to the needs, interests, and wants of the group. To figure out where they are and where they want to go so that I can create moments that move the group forward in a way they wouldn’t have been able to otherwise.

We&amp;rsquo;re not willing to manufacture Facilitator Cards if (1) they won&amp;rsquo;t be amazing; (2) they will be the byproduct of the abuse of workers or unsafe/unhealthy/unfair labor practices; and (3) we&amp;rsquo;ll be creating a carbon footprint by printing and shipping the cards.
