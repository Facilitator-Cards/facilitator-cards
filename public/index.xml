Unlimited is a great amount when it comes to amusement park rides or data you are allowed to use. But unlimited can go from fun to overwhelming when you‚Äôre trying to make definitive choices on how to facilitate a group.
For my first ten years facilitating, I often made choices based on the type of interaction style I thought the group needed. If we‚Äôd been doing a lot of large-group activities, I‚Äôd pick something in pairs or small groups.</description></item><item><title>Early bird.

Hello Wet Erase.</title><link>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/testing-and-changing-directions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/testing-and-changing-directions/</guid><description>For months, our plan was for the cards to be dry erase. This was one of the requirements for our manufacturer. But it turns out wet erase (think overhead projectors) is the way to go. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
It&amp;rsquo;s important to be able to stack the cards and not Etch-a-Sketch all of your plans.

I used to spend a lot of time trying to figure what the group needed before I arrived.</description></item><item><title>The Questions We Asked Every Potential Manufacturer</title><link>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/questions-we-asked-manufacturers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/questions-we-asked-manufacturers/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk deal-breakers. We&amp;rsquo;re not willing to manufacture Facilitator Cards if (1) they won&amp;rsquo;t be amazing; (2) they will be the byproduct of the abuse of workers or unsafe/unhealthy/unfair labor practices; and (3) we&amp;rsquo;ll be creating a carbon footprint by printing and shipping the cards.
As it turns out, this is a tall order.
Most of the things Meg &amp;amp; I make together are digital (curricula, online resources for facilitators &amp;amp; educators, facilitation guides, etc.</description></item><item><title>Intro to the Facilitator Cards Blog</title><link>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/intro-to-the-blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/intro-to-the-blog/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re going to be using this blog as a platform to talk about a few things: the creation of the Facilitator Cards, how we (and others, and you) are using them, and other facilitation &amp;amp; training resources we feel compelled to share.
Beyond being a home to the cards themselves, our goal for this site is to serve as a gallery of related resources. Everything that falls into that bucket will be introduced on the blog.</description></item><item><title>How to Use</title><link>https://www.facilitator.cards/how/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.facilitator.cards/how/</guid><description>Coming soon.
