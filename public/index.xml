And they’re erase-able (and waterproof!), so you can use them again &amp;amp; again (&amp;amp; again).</description></item><item><title>Goodbye Dry Erase. Hello Wet Erase.</title><link>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/testing-and-changing-directions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/testing-and-changing-directions/</guid><description>For months, our plan was for the cards to be dry erase. This was one of the requirements for our manufacturer. But it turns out wet erase (think overhead projectors) is the way to go. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:
It&amp;rsquo;s important to be able to stack the cards and not Etch-a-Sketch all of your plans.

We&amp;rsquo;re not willing to manufacture Facilitator Cards if (1) they won&amp;rsquo;t be amazing; (2) they will be the byproduct of the abuse of workers or unsafe/unhealthy/unfair labor practices; and (3) we&amp;rsquo;ll be creating a carbon footprint by printing and shipping the cards.

Most of the things Meg &amp;amp; I make together are digital (curricula, online resources for facilitators &amp;amp; educators, facilitation guides, etc.</description></item><item><title>Intro to the Facilitator Cards Blog</title><link>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/intro-to-the-blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/intro-to-the-blog/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re going to be using this blog as a platform to talk about a few things: the creation of the Facilitator Cards, how we (and others, and you) are using them, and other facilitation &amp;amp; training resources we feel compelled to share.
