<li><strong>Pay me a monthly salary.</strong> <br/>You choose the amount ($1 per month minimum), based on
what you think my work is worth, what’s in the budget, or
how much you want to give.</li>
<li><strong>Oversee my day-to-day operations.</strong> <br/>I’ll share regular updates about what I’m working on, what
my plans are, and what’s falling apart.</li>
<li><strong>Weigh in via polls and ideas.</strong> <br/>Let me know what you think I should be working on,
and how I might be able to make you proud. Will I
always follow direction? No. But…</li>
<li><strong>Fire me or give me a raise.</strong> <br/>Am I not up to your caliber? Lay me off. Am I
outperforming your expectations? Give me a raise.
My salary is in your hands.</li>
