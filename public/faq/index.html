    <h3>How is this different from Patreon?</h3>
    <p>First, to be perfectly clear: this whole operation is <a href="https://patreon.com/killermann" title="Sam Killermann on Patreon">powered <em>by</em> Patreon</a>.</p>
    <p>But the way I&rsquo;m doing this is different from other Patreon-ers on two fronts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>My patrons don&rsquo;t get more of what I create (more comics, more articles, more podcasts, more whatever), or exclusive access to my creations.</li>
        <li>My patrons aren&rsquo;t funding my work in just one dimenison (e.g., writing for a particular site, creating a particular podcast).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The relationship between me and my &ldquo;patrons&rdquo; is more similar to the historical usage of the word than the way most people are using it on Patreon.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m not viewing patrons as &ldquo;super consumers.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not creating for my patrons. We, together, are creating for the world. <a href="https://politicworm.com/oxford/oxfords-life-in-a-nutshell-shakespeare/shakespeares-patrons/">Like Shakespeare and his patrons</a>.</p>
    <p>Only I don&rsquo;t expect you to be an Earl, and I surely hope you don&rsquo;t expect me to be the Bard.</p>
    <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
    <p>You choose my salary. My ask is that base it on what feels right for <em>you</em>, based on your financial ability, sense of gratitude or fairness, or whatever else moves you.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s no minimum (beyond the $1 threshold, which Patreon sets) no maximum, and you&rsquo;re welcome to adjust what you pay every month.</p>
    <h3>Is the color scheme of this site based on a pair of socks and a scarf you own?</h3>
    <p>Yeppppppppp.</p>
</section>
<section class="faq" id="more-faqs">
    <h3>Do we get special benefits for being your employer?</h3>
    <p>You mean beyond the benefit of being able to &ndash; collectively, with one another and with me &ndash; take credit for all the good we&rsquo;re doing? Yes! Here are three concrete things:</p>
    <ol><li><strong>Employer discounts on any physical thing I make</strong>: you can get anything for the base cost, or whatever beyond that you want to pay. Just ask.</li>
    <li><strong>Participate in Quarterly Reviews</strong>: every three months you&rsquo;ll get the chance to review my performance, and I&rsquo;ll do a Q&amp;A with my bosses.</li>
    <li><strong>Insider perspective</strong>: get a full view behind the scenes of everything that goes into the things I make, publish, and do.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Is this legal?</h3>
    <p>I assume so. Granted, technically speaking, in a legal sense, you aren&rsquo;t my &ldquo;boss&rdquo; &mdash; so you&rsquo;re not on the hook for things like healthcare (don&rsquo;t have it) or worker&rsquo;s comp (hope I don&rsquo;t need it).</p>
    <p>Also, since we are speaking technically, my lawyer is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BkgEtu2no8W/" title="Chewie">a puppy</a>. So I&rsquo;ll hand this one <a href="https://www.patreon.com/legal" title="Patreon Legl">over to Patreon</a>.</p>
