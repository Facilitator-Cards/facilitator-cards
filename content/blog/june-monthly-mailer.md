## 🕶 **June Monthly Mailer from Facilitator Cards**

Hey Facilitators,

It’s June! Things are heating up and we’ve got a ton of info for you—hot off the presses. Two events coming up this month, loads of pro tips, Instagram guides, and YouTube videos to check out. Let’s get into it!

## 🎁 What to Expect When You Open Your New Deck

We made a little unboxing video of Facilitator Cards to answer three questions:

* What to expect when you open your deck
* What the colors and symbols on Facilitator Cards mean
* And why we love the cards so much!

## **📆 Events Coming Up This Month!**

### **🦈** [**Become a Card Shark**](https://lu.ma/cardsharks) **- Tuesday, June 7 @ 12-1pm ET**

Card Sharks is the session designed to help you get the most out of your deck of Facilitator Cards. In this 60-minute session, you will:

1. Learn new cards and combinations you can easily implement in your next workshop
2. Figure out how to find the cards you need (and not get overwhelmed by the rest!)
3. Work through real-life scenarios to figure out a plan with your Facilitator Cards

It’s totally free, you’ll meet other wonderful facilitators in our community, and if you’ve got your deck of Facilitator Cards then you can [RSVP right now](https://lu.ma/cardsharks)!

_And if you don’t have a deck yet, if you order them **today** they may still arrive in time for this month's Card Sharks! Use code CARDSHARK for 10% off your deck._

### 🃏 [What are Facilitator Cards?](https://lu.ma/wtffc) - Wed, June 8 @ 4-5pm ET

Do you know anyone who’s been curious about Facilitator Cards? Got yourself a deck and want to know more about why we designed them the way we did? This is the place to be!

This session will be an interactive workshop that will help you understand the theory and structure behind Facilitator Cards and how you can use them to improve the sessions and meetings you're already leading, no matter if you're a seasoned pro or a brand new facilitator.

Totally free, [RSVP here](https://lu.ma/wtffc)! Share with your friends and colleagues!

## **👀 In Case You Missed It**

### 🤸‍♂️ May FC Playground REPLAY

In last month’s playground, we explored the brainstorming process [**Different Angles**](https://www.facilitator.cards/cards/different-angles/) and the decision-making activity [**Inside vs. Outside Thinking**](https://www.facilitator.cards/cards/inside-vs-outside-thinking/). We left with new ideas, insights, and had a super interesting discussion about whether or not trainings should be mandatory. [Check out the recording here](https://youtu.be/efJie92UV_0)! (You’ll even see some behind-the-scenes stuff when folks are in breakout rooms 😃)

### 🦈 May Card Sharks REPLAY

Every month we get together as a Facilitator Cards community to get to know our cards and use them to brainstorm ideas for common facilitation scenarios. Last month we had a great session and if you missed it, check out [the video](https://youtu.be/tIKPx4ya8mE)! Following along with this video is a great option if you can’t make it to a live Card Shark session (or want a preview of what to expect when you come!).

[_BONUS the last 10 minutes are a few of us thinking through a hybrid meeting challenge so check that out if you’re looking for some of my thoughts on hybrid._](https://youtu.be/tIKPx4ya8mE?t=2700)
