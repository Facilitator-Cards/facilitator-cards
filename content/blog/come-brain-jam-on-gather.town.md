+++
Brain Jams are Facilitator Cards community events where we bring together facilitators to explore creative ways to use new tools and technologies to enhance our facilitation. Join us for our first Brain Jam of 2021: Using [Gather](https://gather.town) for Virtual Facilitation!

[Gather](https://gather.town/) is a proximity-based video chat platform that we think has a lot of promise for virtual facilitation. The Brain Jams will take place Feb 3rd at 2pm PT (5pm ET, 10pm GMT, 9am Feb 4th AEST) and Feb 4th at 9am PT (12pm ET, 5pm GMT) and you can [RSVP here](https://hues.typeform.com/to/JsdzcHFy).

## What is Gather?

Gather is a video-conferencing interface that differs significantly from the Zooms and Google Meets of the world. For one, it feels more like a video game than a stuffy remote meeting.

When you arrive in a Gather room, you appear as a 2D avatar that you can move around the room. When you walk up to another person in the room, you‚Äôll start to see that person‚Äôs video and hear their audio and they will be able to hear and see you. When one of you walks away, your audio and video will fade and eventually disappear.

Here‚Äôs [a demo](https://youtu.be/8orexZsFRxs?t=19) of what this looks like in action:

{{< youtube 8orexZsFRxs?t=46 >}}

Gather also integrates objects that you can use with others while you‚Äôre in the space, like whiteboards, Google Docs, and even YouTube videos. If you want to get a taste of what it looks like to move around a room in Gather, you can [explore this example room](https://gather.town/app/jtguOJTf6LYk71me/facilitate). (Bonus: if you run into anyone in that Gathering, know they are part of our Facilitator Cards community as well!).

Until I started exploring Gather, I hadn‚Äôt realized just how much limitation I had gotten used to in virtual facilitation (using platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc.). **Gather opens up new and creative potential as a facilitator and we‚Äôre excited to explore**...

* How movement in a virtual space might grant more agency to participants in virtual facilitations;
* If group work changes when participants can easily move and interact between groups and shared documents;
* Ways to virtually facilitate activities where physical space is a vital part of the process (like [Spectrum Questions](https://www.facilitator.cards/cards/spectrum-questions/));
* Co-facilitating when you can independently check in with your group and with your co-facilitator; and
* The ways different virtual settings can create a mood or set a tone with your group.

## Details for the Brain Jam

While our past Brain Jams, including the ones on [MURAL](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/using-mural-for-virtual-facilitation-canning-the-brain-jam/) and [AhaSlides](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/using-ahaslides-for-virtual-facilitation-canning-the-brain-jam/), have been hosted on Zoom, this one will be hosted on Gather so we can explore and experience all of its functionalities as a video hosting platform.

To allow our minds to run wild with the creativity possibilities of Gather, the first thing we‚Äôll do in the Brain Jams is get to know Gather. How far do you have to be before someone‚Äôs video comes into view? How do you move around the room? How do private spaces work? What are the different features and functions of this platform?

After that we‚Äôll spend time in small groups, exploring ways to use some of the integrations including whiteboards and Google Docs Gather offers in our facilitations. Finally, we‚Äôll crowdsource ideas for how to use Gather for facilitation processes we love that aren‚Äôt easy to facilitate on Zoom or the typical video-conferencing platforms. We might even end with a field trip to the beach üèù, you‚Äôll have to join in to find out.

Please note that it‚Äôs important to be on time. Gather is a new platform for most of us and you‚Äôre liable to get lost if you arrive late. With all Brain Jams, the sessions are highly interaction-based and it‚Äôs best when we can all start together.
