# March Monthly Mailer

Hey Facilitators,

Welcome to Monday, to April, to Quarter 2!

Want to know something wild? Facilitator Cards are officially three years old!

🥳 Happy Birthday Facilitator Cards!!!

On April 1st, 2020 we were officially funded on Kickstarter by 350+ wonderful people who believed in us in the midst of one of the most tumultuous times in our lives, and we are forever grateful. Every one of those people helped get this business off the ground and changed our lives and the ability to do this work we love so much. So thank YOU Kickstarter backers and thank YOU to everyone who’s come since we are so overjoyed we get to do this work every day and it’s because of all of you!

## 🗓 Upcoming Events

### 🚨 [Navigating Triggers](https://lu.ma/fctriggers) - April 20th @ 1 - 2:30pm ET

This 90-minute virtual workshop is dedicated to cultivating mindsets and building strategies to help you stay calm and present—no matter what happens or what is said in the session, workshop, or meeting we’re leading.

Whether you’re looking to better understand what happens when we get triggered or want to secure your mindset **before** you step in the room, this event is packed with strategies to help!

We will cover:

* A step-by-step breakdown of what happens when you get triggered
* Mindsets you can prepare before you get in the room to help avoid potential triggers
* Strategies to use when you are triggered to help you return to a centered space

_Psst…interested in having your team attend? Reply to this and we’ll let you know about our group rates!_

### 🦈 [Become A Card Shark](https://lu.ma/cardsharks) - May 9 @ 4pm ET

## 🧢 Put on your [Facilitator Hat](https://shop.facilitator.cards/products/facilitator-hat-5-panel)

Did you know we make _literal_ [Facilitator Hats](https://shop.facilitator.cards/products/facilitator-hat-1)?

It’s a hat that immediately helps you identify your people (you know, the ones that don’t ask “What’s a facilitator?”) and we gotta say, it’s a crowd-pleaser every single time we put it on during a workshop.

Available in [mesh trucker style](https://shop.facilitator.cards/products/facilitator-hat-1) and [five-panel](https://shop.facilitator.cards/products/facilitator-hat-5-panel)!

## 🎲 Cozy, Juicy, Real

Cozy, Juicy, Real is a connection-building experience disguised as a board/party game. We hosted a CJR play-sesh together as a community a while back and it was a hit! And now, the digital has become physical and this month CJR launched their Kickstarter to fund making the party game into a real-life physical version you can play with friends, family, and community.

We dig CJR, just pledged our support to get a box, and wanted to make sure that you knew it was going on! Plus as many of you know, great things (like Facilitator Cards!) can start on Kickstarter so shout out to all the micro-creators out there making big things happen with the support of the crowd!

## **🃏**[**Card Of The Month: Thinking & Feeling**](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/april-card-of-the-month-thinking-feeling/)

Calling all logical **_and_** emotional thinkers!

[Thinking & Feeling](https://www.facilitator.cards/cards/thinking-feeling/) is a dynamic framework used to surface emotions. With these clear communication guidelines, the group knows exactly **_how_** to respond.

### Why We 💙 It

The more specific we can be with instructions, the easier it is for participants to respond. Asking a group of adults to voice their emotions can be a tricky thing to balance, but by providing a logical buffer we mitigate some of that social risk.

That’s a wrap on April’s mailer! Thanks so much for being part of our community, another extra-special thanks to those who helped us start this whole thing 3 years ago, and we hope to see everyone at an event soon.

Until next time, happy facilitating!

Meg & the Facilitator Cards Team
