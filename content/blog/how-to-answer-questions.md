Answering questions honestly and deftly is an important skill for any leader, educator, or facilitator.

Answering questions establishes trust within your group, sets the tone for space, and can communicate how open (or closed) you are to challenge, curiosity, and confusion.

There’s a level of self-discipline it takes to do well and some skills that you can build up to get better and better at answering questions.

## Know Your Goal

The goal in answering questions for us is to have our answers reinforce the experience we want people to have in our sessions and to, when possible, give them the information that _they’re_ looking for.

When we’re able to respond in ways that are gracious, educational, and helpful, the group will naturally be more inclined to pay attention and understand and trust the scope of our knowledge.

It’s also easy to break trust if we respond in irritation, roll our eyes, or start our answers with, “Obviously…”. Participants will intake our verbal and body language to forecast future interactions.

## It’s About What THEY Want to Know

One of the hardest things for folks who are content experts or those of us who are incredibly passionate about the information we are sharing is knowing when to stop talking.

It’s easy to give people too much information.

Imagine that the information you’re giving someone is a physical object. Every piece of information you hand them is something else they have to hold and if you overload them, they might not just drop the last few pieces you gave them, they might drop the whole thing.

Remember, when we are inviting people to ask questions, it’s about their needs and not what _we_ find most interesting. There is a balance to strike there, but we need to land on “what is this person looking for” and not “what do I want to tell them”.

If someone asks a yes or no question… your first response should be a yes or no answer.

If you then want to elaborate (or better yet, the participant wants you to!) you can. But start with the simple yes or no.

## Take Questions Seriously

Answer all questions like the person is asking them from a real place (even when you know they’re not).

It can be easy to dismiss someone as just playing devil’s advocate or coming from bad faith, but so often with questions, even if the asker isn’t genuinely curious about the answer, someone else in the room _does_ sincerely have that question. Therefore we think it’s important to respond as if that question stems from genuine curiosity whenever possible.

Sometimes we’ve found it helpful to reimagine the person who is asking that question as someone we really care about or have a lot of patience for, which allows us to be more generous in our response.

## There’s a Bit of Math Involved

If you spend 5 minutes answering one question you’re going to get through fewer questions.

Do the math ahead of time and figure out how many questions you can answer in the time you want to give to questions.

It’s so tempting to give thorough answers at the beginning but you’ll end up rushing through some important ones at the end, so we often like to set timers or keep a stopwatch going on our phones throughout to keep us on pace for giving each question it’s due.

Question & Answers Sessions are a cornerstone in workshops, meetings, and seminars. They provide a unique opportunity for in-the-moment feedback and with just a little bit of structure we can create the optimal situation to get earnest and important questions from all of our participants.
