## 👻 **October Monthly Mailer from Facilitator Cards**

**Boo!**

(Did we get ya?)

Whoa, it’s already Q4? It’s week 40/52?! Now _that’s_ something to scream about!

Well, we’re planning to make the most out of the next few months! Keep reading to find out all the good stuff we’ve got coming up in October & anything you may have missed in September.

## **📆 Trainings Coming Up This Month!**

### 🧑‍🏫 [**Holding Space: Generous approaches to problematic statements and conflict**](https://lu.ma/holdingspaceoct) **- October 25 @ 12PM ET — $49**

Hate feeling caught off guard when someone says something problematic or conflict-inducing in the groups you lead?

Us too!

For _years_ we lived in fear that if our groups got _too_ real if we opened up participation a little _too_ much, someone was going to say something harmful that would throw the group (and us) into chaos.

But there are moves we can make as facilitators that shape the outcome of those moments!

**Come learn what those options are and feel ready the next time conflict arises.**

Alrighty then, that is going to do it for the October Mailer!

We spent a lot of time in September getting to facilitate a whole bunch of events with some truly incredible groups of people. It was a great reminder that one of the major joys of being a facilitator is getting to have wonderful and dynamic conversations with folks from all around the world. These events and workshops are really made by the people who come to them, and if we’ve been lucky enough to have you at one of our events, thank you for coming! We hope that you know it truly would not have been the same without you there.

Thank you all so much for being part of our community, and until next time, happy facilitating!

Meg & the Facilitator Cards Team
