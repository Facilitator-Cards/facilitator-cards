Hey Facilitators,

Woohoo, welcome to April!

Time for spring, for flowers to bloom, and for some of us to shake off the (in-person) cobwebs and remember how to write on a flip chart (and question how we ever wore real pants _every day_ 🤓).

## **📆 FC Community Events Coming Up This Month!**

### **🤸** [**April - Facilitator Cards Playground**](https://lu.ma/playground) **- April 13 @ 2pm ET / 11am PT**

Come and get new tools for your facilitation toolbox! At The Playground, we go over two different facilitation processes and then have plenty of time for debrief & discussion with the entire group!

Last month, one of the cards picked was [100 Ideas](https://www.facilitator.cards/cards/100-bad-ideas/). Check out the [MURAL board](https://app.mural.co/t/facilitatorcards8356/m/facilitatorcards8356/1646923831106/8a318c497a951309ca8ed7b8e032426db2d5eeed?sender=meg4054) we made with 100 icebreakers! If you missed last months don’t worry, you can watch the event recording [here!](https://youtu.be/MJWf9XKAYw0)

What processes will we explore this month? You decide! This session is totally free, you don’t need Facilitator Cards to attend, and it’s limited to 25 people, so [**snag your spot now**](https://lu.ma/playground)!

### **🦈** [**April - Become a Card Shark**](https://lu.ma/cardsharks) **- April 13 @ 12pm ET / 9am PT**

Card Sharks is our getting-started-with-your-Facilitator-Cards session and is guided hands-on practice time with your deck that will leave you feeling ready to use the cards anytime (whether you’re planning an agenda in advance or pulling them out last minute in a training).

It’s a quick one-hour session and all you need is your deck and to [**RSVP here**](https://lu.ma/cardsharks)! There is no cost to attend; this session is included with your purchase of Facilitator Cards.

We asked some of last month’s participants what they’re taking away from the session and wanted to share some of their thoughts below:

“I learned about the cards in a way I had not before. Very effective!” “It’s given me lots of ideas.” “Collaboration works!”

[Hope to see you there!](https://lu.ma/cardsharks)

## 🃏Get to Know 4 Facilitator Cards in 4 Minutes

We all know that sometimes, the most powerful way we can learn about something is by hearing someone explain it aloud. 60 Second Tutorials can help you get to know your Facilitator Cards a bit better and provide inspiration and ideas for when you might use them in your sessions.

Last month we published FOUR of these 60 Second Tutorials and you can watch them all at the links below!

## ♣️ Deal Me In

We’ve got a scholarship fund here at Facilitator Cards and 100% of the proceeds from this fund go towards getting under-resourced educators Facilitator Cards decks, guides, and training!

For the month of April, the scholarships are going to educators who work with students in the juvenile justice system. **And this month for a donation of $13** you can send a deck of Facilitator Cards to a teacher in need thanks to our generous sponsor [PopStage](https://popstage.com/)!

Okay everyone, that’s gonna be it for this month’s mailer (whoa! already?!). We hope everyone has a wonderful first month of Spring!

Until next time, happy facilitating!
