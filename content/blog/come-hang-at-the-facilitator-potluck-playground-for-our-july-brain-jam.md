Every month here at Facilitator Cards we explore a new tool, technique, or technology to enhance our facilitation practice. In the past we’ve explored some of our favorite online tools ([Gather](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/using-gather-for-virtual-facilitation-canning-the-brain-jam/), [MURAL](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/using-mural-for-virtual-facilitation-canning-the-brain-jam/), [AhaSlides](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/using-ahaslides-for-virtual-facilitation-canning-the-brain-jam/)) and dived deep on [breakout rooms,](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/march-brain-jam-virtual-breakout-room-best-practices/) emergent facilitation, and more.

This month we’re embracing the summer and hosting a facilitator potluck and inviting our facilitator community to come together to bring something to exchange, and share with each other.

**Hour one will be a Facilitator Potluck** where we’ll invite folks to share something that they’ve done or something they’ve learned from that they think other facilitators would be stoked on.

Each person sharing will get 2-5 minutes to hop on the mic and share with the group before opening it up for a rapid fire round of Q&A. Anyone interested in sharing during the first hour we ask that you make sure your “dish” is (1) something you’ve done or something that you’re inspired by (2) it’s something everyone can do or use (3) it doesn’t take more than 5 minutes to share from start-to-finish. You can do a “tiny-teach” where you simply tell the group a concept, idea, or story OR you can demo or facilitate a short activity.

**Hour two will be a Facilitator Playground** where we’ll invite a few folks who want to try something out to lead the group in an experiment. Perhaps you’re thinking, “Oooooo I’ve always wanted to try to lead a Fishbowl convo but using Google Slides!” The Facilitator Playground is open for you. In the playground we’ll have 3-4 guest facilitators leading experiments for 10-15 minutes. (Experiments involving Facilitator Cards will be first priority!)

Come for hour one or stay for the full two hours. Bring something to share or come to feast on the collective wisdom. The Brain Jam kicks off July 7th at 12pm PT / 3pm ET / 8pm GMT. [RSVP here](https://airtable.com/shryTZVY7ieydXSAy).
