+++
As a facilitator, I‚Äôm entering my second year of online facilitation with mixed emotions. While I feel wholly more prepared to work with folks online, online facilitation is clunky, and the tech headaches of awkward screen shares and weird transitions are tiring. 

The more ambitious I get with my facilitations, adding in [MURAL](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/using-mural-for-virtual-facilitation-canning-the-brain-jam/) or [AhaSlides](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/using-ahaslides-for-virtual-facilitation-canning-the-brain-jam/) or any other piece of tech, the more I have to manage and keep track of during my facilitations. When I‚Äôm facilitating, I don‚Äôt want to have to think about where this window is, am I sharing the right thing, is this a good view of this‚ÄîI just want to be present.

**Last month, I was introduced to a program called** [**OBS**](https://obsproject.com/)**‚ÄîOpen Broadcaster Software‚Äîwhich is a totally free open-source software, and I‚Äôm never again going to facilitating online without it.**

Instead of having to screen share, manage windows, turn on and off slideshows, I can set these things up ahead of time in OBS and simply switch between them with a press of a button. ü•≥

OBS has allowed me to be more present for my participants and more interesting and engaging in the moments where I lecture, and gives me so much less to manage in the moment. So if you want to learn and explore this magical software, come to our April Brain Jam, where we‚Äôll be exploring how to use OBS for virtual facilitation!

**Our OBS Brain Jam is April 7th at 12pm PT / 3pm ET. It runs for an hour (or two, if you want more exploratory time). And it‚Äôs totally free.** [**Just RSVP**](https://airtable.com/shryTZVY7ieydXSAy)**.**

## Why OBS Is Awesome for Facilitators

One of the clunkiest things for me as a virtual facilitator is managing all the windows, screens, and things I want to be sharing with my participants. In a single facilitation I might have two windows I want to share at different times and an opening slide deck for the first 5 minutes, and I‚Äôm trying to manage all of that while making eye contact with my camera and monitoring the chat.

OBS has helped with all of this because it allows me to prepare ahead of time for all the changes I want to make to a workshop and then switch between those ‚Äúscenes‚Äù directly in my webcam in Zoom. Here are a few examples and setups I‚Äôve been using in some of my sessions this last month. Keep in mind: in all of these images **I‚Äôm not screen sharing;** this is what people are seeing instead of my usual video window.

I‚Äôve used OBS to create a live countdown timer for when people arrive early.

I used OBS to show my slides and a video of me simultaneously.

I‚Äôve played around with slightly more involved setups where I have a video of me over a background image, text above me, and my slides to the side.

I‚Äôve even used OBS to help me show two camera angles at once: one using my phone pointed down at the desk and the other my normal webcam.

You can use OBS in Zoom or in any other program where you use your webcam. I can switch between all of these views (called scenes in OBS) with the tap of a button.

As one of my fellow facilitators said when I did a little demo of this software, ‚ÄúThis is magic, my brain is spinning with possibilities.‚Äù

So what will our OBS Brain Jam look like?

## 60+60 Flow of the Brain Jam: What to Expect

For our Brain Jams we split up the time into a 60/60 format. First is getting to know, learn, and try out the software in the first 60 minutes; the second 60 is for active experimentation. The second 60 is totally optional but is a fun chance to dig into the software more, bounce ideas off of other facilitators, and get into the weeds.

The first hour of our OBS Brain Jam will be all about building scenes (like a few of the ones above) in OBS, learning how to switch between them, and practicing switching between the scenes in Zoom. No prior OBS experience required‚Äîas long as you have it downloaded and properly installed, we‚Äôll work together from there. When you RSVP you‚Äôll receive an email with install tips!

The second (totally optional) hour of the Brain Jam will be all about experimenting and trying things out with OBS. What are creative things we can do, now that we know the basics of OBS? How can we use it to make our lives simpler as facilitators? What are advantages to no longer having to screen share? We‚Äôll have a chance to explore all of this and more in our second hour together.

## What You‚Äôll Need for the Brain Jam

To join this Brain Jam you do need to install the OBS software on your computer and run a few tests to make sure that the software has all the permissions that it needs to work.

When you RSVP for the Brain Jam we‚Äôll send you an email with all you need to know about installing OBS. Installing OBS can be intimidating for some, but don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll guide you through it. You do not need to be any sort of tech wizard to make it work. If you have built a slide deck in PowerPoint or edited an image in Canva, you can do it. (And if you‚Äôve never built a slide deck and you‚Äôre reading this, please tell me your story.)

Here‚Äôs all that you‚Äôll need to participate in the Jam:

* OBS installed on your computer (it‚Äôs totally free)
* Webcam
* Microphone
* Ability to tune into Zoom on your computer (as we‚Äôll be using/building in OBS throughout the Jam)

While it‚Äôs not required, it‚Äôll be super handy to have two monitors for this Brain Jam if possible, your laptop set up next to a single external monitor will work perfectly.

All that‚Äôs left is to [RSVP](https://airtable.com/shryTZVY7ieydXSAy).

Any other questions please reach out anytime at hello@facilitator.cards. Otherwise, see you at the Jam!
