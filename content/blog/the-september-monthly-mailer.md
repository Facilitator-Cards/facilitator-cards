## 🥞 **September Monthly Mailer from Facilitator Cards**

Hey Facilitators,

Whoa, hey, it’s September already! Does that word also evoke the smell of fresh Ticonderoga pencils being sharpened in those really satisfying crank sharpeners or are we…dating ourselves? Whatever September means to you, for us we’re looking forward to cold morning walks and good icebreaker questions.

We’ve got events, icebreaker info, Zoom tricks, and a new card of the month for you this month - let’s get into it!

## **📆 Events Coming Up This Month!**

### **🦈** [**Become a Card Shark**](https://lu.ma/cardsharks) **- Sept 7**

Card Sharks is the session designed to help you get the most out of your deck of Facilitator Cards. In this 60-minute session, you will:

1. Learn new cards and combinations you can easily implement in your next workshop or meeting
2. Figure out how to find the cards you need (and not get overwhelmed by the rest!)
3. Work through real-life scenarios and experience how to plan with your Facilitator Cards

It’s totally free, you’ll meet other wonderful facilitators in our community, and if you’ve got your deck of Facilitator Cards then you can [RSVP right now](https://lu.ma/cardsharks)!

_And if you don’t have a deck yet, order them **today** and join us next month! Use code CARDSHARK for 10% off your deck._

### **🤸** [**Facilitator Cards Playground**](https://lu.ma/playground) **- Sept 8**

Want to learn new facilitation processes and geek out with other wonderful facilitator folks? Join us Thursday Sept 8th at [The Playground](https://lu.ma/playground)! Get some new ideas and processes for your toolbox with our incredible facilitator community.

We’ll explore two new facilitation frameworks both as participants and then analyze them from the facilitator’s perspective. Never been and want to see what it’s all about? [Check out a past recording here](https://youtu.be/XZwoXwZ9-1g).

This session is totally free, **you don’t need Facilitator Cards to attend,** and it’s limited to 25 people, so [snag your spot now](https://lu.ma/playground)!

## **🪄** [**1-Day Training - The Magic of Facilitation - Oct 5**](https://www.notion.so/September-Monthly-Mailer-c3056122d8434827a6daca53abfb4039)

Good facilitation makes time fly, _great_ facilitation is a game changer.

In this session we will explore what the essential choices and moves we make as facilitators that make all the difference in our sessions. You'll walk away way with specific tactics and techniques to improve your future facilitations, while building confidence to flex your plan to meet your group in the moment.

This session is built around our favorite facilitation tool, [Facilitator Cards](http://facilitator.cards/). You'll leave not only knowing the philosophy and approach behind these cards but also get some hands-on practice time using the cards to solve facilitation challenges.

[https://lu.ma/OctIntensive](https://lu.ma/OctIntensive "https://lu.ma/OctIntensive") (GET YOUR TICKET HERE!)

This intensive is limited to 25 people to ensure it is a personalized experience where participants get to know, grow, and connect with other facilitators.

Ice ice baby 🥶

We _know_ there are plenty of icebreakers being wedged into the start of classes, sessions, and workshops, but please, we beg, don’t ask for fun facts or make everyone participate in two truths and a lie! Instead, check out some of our favorite frameworks to break the ice with (don’t worry—we included prompts for all of them as well)!
