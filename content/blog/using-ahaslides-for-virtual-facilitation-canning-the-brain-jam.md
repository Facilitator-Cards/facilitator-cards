+++
For [our second Brain Jam](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/rsvp-for-our-facilitator-brain-jam-using-ahaslides-for-virtual-facilitation/), Meg facilitated two Zoom sessions where we explored the live-polling software [AhaSlides](https://ahaslides.com/), coming up with ways it might help us clear our biggest virtual facilitation hurdles. I’m here to share some of the ideas I was most excited about.

If you’ve never used AhaSlides, think [Poll Everywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/?ref=PIW0qgbZ&campaignid=9995717487&adgroupid=102219838233&keyword=poll%20everywhere&matchtype=e&device=c&keywordid=aud-602677925722:kwd-304786950627&gclid=CjwKCAjwmMX4BRAAEiwA-zM4JhErc5n0lwYZwep4E40e1mHCIIR1cOyMmzZRAoh00toudAYCkiYxThoC_QIQAvD_BwE), but easier, and with a more inviting, modern user interface. And if you’ve never used either, you’re in for a treat.

As someone who had used Poll Everywhere a bunch, AhaSlides was an absolute delight. When Meg and I were talking about focusing on this tech for the second Brain Jam, I was sold as soon as I created my first poll question (which took about 10 seconds).

For me, whether or not I add AhaSlides to my virtual toolbelt is a matter of what tools from in-person trainings it would replace (as you know if you read my write-up about [modifying in-person activities for virtual facilitation](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/modifying-in-person-activities-for-virtual-facilitation/)), and how easily I can orient participants to the tech.

If it does a great job of replacing a prop or process I relied on heavily in my in-person facilitation, and it’s easy for participants to use it, it’s a win in my book.

What’s the verdict for AhaSlides? I think you’ll be able to guess my vote by the end of this post. First I’ll do a brief recap of what happened in the Brain Jam, then share a few of my favorite ideas we came up with for using AhaSlides in our digital meetings.

## **The AhaSlides Brain Jam Recap**

As you know, because you’re a facilitator, watching a recording of a facilitation experience isn’t the same as participating. But we have the video below for your watching regardless And if you’re not a facilitator, how did you get past the guard?

What you’ll see if you watch that video, and the general flow of this week’s Brain Jam:

1. An intro from Meg explaining what I’m about to explain here in writing
2. Overview of what AhaSlides is, the different types of questions you can ask, what the back-end looks like for facilitators, all in real-time as Meg is using it to collect info from us (that would later serve as our focus for small group time!)
3. We broke out into [subcommittees](https://www.facilitator.cards/cards/subcommittees/) (by facilitation field) to tackle virtual facilitation challenges we identified and co-create AhaSlides presentations that might help in our various settings
4. Back in the large group, we shared our ideas and slides with everyone else, testing out the poll questions in real-time
5. Then we repeated #3 and #4 again with a new facilitation challenge
6. Finally, Meg did some [anonymous Q & A](https://www.facilitator.cards/cards/anonymous-qa/) about all things AhaSlides, and we said our goodbyes

The video is a hodge-podge of both Brain Jams (one was on Tuesday, July 7th, and the other Thursday, July 9th), with only the large group time recorded. So you can see the fruits produced by the subcommittee discussions, but not the seed planting and germination.
