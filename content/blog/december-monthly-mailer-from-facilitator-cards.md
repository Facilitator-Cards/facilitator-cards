## ✨ December **Monthly Mailer from Facilitator Cards**

Oh wow, it’s here, the final Monthly Mailer of 2022!

What a year it’s been, folks! We’re sure you have plenty of exciting stuff up ahead this month, so we’ll get right into it.

## **📆 Events Coming Up This Month!**

### [🧘 2022: A guided year-end review, with Meg! ](https://lu.ma/2022wasayear)- December 9 @ 1 PM ET

Join us for a reflective look back at the past year! For the last 5 years Meg has been doing a year-end-review to take a look back at the past year of being a self-employed/small business owner to ask the following questions:

* What went well?
* What do I want to do more of?
* Where did my time go this year?
* What lessons do I want to carry into the next year?

There will be short invitations for interaction at the beginning and end, and the majority of this session will be spent in solo reflection on our own work, businesses, and lives (with these questions as the key focus points!).

_A note on pricing: this event is name-your-price. For many of us paying for events holds us accountable for showing up. You're welcome to pay our suggested price ($25), pay more (if you'd like to!), or less (including $0!). No matter what you choose, we’d love to see you there._
