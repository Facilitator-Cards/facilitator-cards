## **✨ January Monthly Mailer from Facilitator Cards**

Hello hello, welcome to January! This month always feels sparkly and new (and if like us you’re residing in the northeast part of the United States, it’s also **cold**). Has anyone successfully written 2023 on the first try yet?

## **📆 Events Coming Up This Month!**

### **🦈** [**Become a Card Shark**](https://lu.ma/cardsharks) **- January 12 @ 2PM ET**

When you buy your deck of Facilitator Cards, you also gain access to our bi-monthly live workshop where we help Card Carriers become Card Sharks.

In this 60-minute session, you will:

1. Figure out how to find the cards you need (without getting overwhelmed by the rest!)
2. Work through real-life scenarios and experience how to plan with your Facilitator Cards
3. Spend time getting to know other folks in our incredible Facilitator Cards community

[RSVP HERE!](https://lu.ma/cardsharks)

**You will need your deck of Facilitator Cards _in hand_ to attend this session.**
