## 🪩 **August Monthly Mailer from Facilitator Cards**

Hey Facilitators,

Welcome to August!

It’s always a little satisfying when the month starts on a Monday, isn’t it? Happy Monday!

## 🌎 We Became A B Corp!

Last month we officially got our B Corp certification. If you don’t know much about B Corps they are, ”businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.” It’s a rigorous application process and it ensures a level of public and social accountability to our business practices, which we are excited about!

You can check out our score (105 baby!) and [public B Corp profile here](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/company/facilitator-cards-pbc). We’ll be sharing more in the future about why we decided to pursue this, what the process was like as a small (tiny) business, and how we used the process to shape our everyday business decisions.

Fun fact! We’re the 52nd B Corp in the great little state, Vermont! Even more fun, VT has the most B Corps per capita in the country (and the most delicious B Corp - hat tip to Ben & Jerry)!

## **📆 Events Coming Up This Month!**

### **🦈** [**Become a Card Shark**](https://lu.ma/cardsharks) **- Tuesday, August 9 @ 12-1pm ET**

Card Sharks is the session designed to help you get the most out of your deck of Facilitator Cards. In this 60-minute session, you will:

1. Learn new cards and combinations you can easily implement in your next workshop or meeting
2. Figure out how to find the cards you need (and not get overwhelmed by the rest!)
3. Work through real-life scenarios and experience how to plan with your Facilitator Cards

It’s totally free, you’ll meet other wonderful facilitators in our community, and if you’ve got your deck of Facilitator Cards then you can [RSVP right now](https://lu.ma/cardsharks)!

_And if you don’t have a deck yet, if you order them **today** they may still arrive in time for this month's Card Sharks! Use code CARDSHARK for 10% off your deck._

### **🤸** [**Facilitator Cards Playground**](https://lu.ma/playground) **- Wednesday August 10 @ 3pm ET**

The Playground is BACK! Join us Wednesday August 10th and get some new ideas and processes for your toolbox with our incredible facilitator community.

### 🔮 [Facilitating For The Future](https://lu.ma/fffsj) - Tuesday August 30 @ 2pm ET

**Are you a social justice facilitator?** BOY HOWDY do we have the event for you! We’re going to be running a one-hour event called Facilitating for the Future which is going to focus on two questions. What is Social Justice Education uniquely good at? And how do we as facilitators best show up to get the most out of that unique opportunity?

This session is free for our community and [**you can RSVP here**](https://lu.ma/fffsj) (and we encourage you to share this event with anyone doing Social Justice Education who you think would be interested!)

If you’re like, “WOW this is amazing! I wish there was more than just a one-hour event to talk about this.” You’re in luck! We’re planning a cohort to meet once a week for 5 weeks starting in Oct and we’ve got an [interest form for that cohort right here](https://airtable.com/shr0LNpkRWGuMgnUE)!
