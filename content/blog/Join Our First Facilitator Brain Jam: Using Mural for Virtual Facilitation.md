In the wake of COVID-19, many of us have found ourselves thrust into a world of virtual facilitation for the first time. Weâ€™re having to put down many of the tools we know and love that donâ€™t translate into this new virtual space. As facilitators, we want to keep our groups engaged and our processes dynamic, but we need to find [new tools and new ways](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/modifying-in-person-activities-for-virtual-facilitation/) to adapt to make that happen.

To support our community in getting creative and inventive using new technologies, weâ€™re kicking off a virtual facilitation tips series weâ€™re calling Facilitator Brain Jams, this Friday, May 15th! Our first topic will be **Using Mural for Virtual Facilitation.**

With a second session on May 19th (20th if youâ€™re in AEST) on the same topic to make it easier for folks in different time zones to join.

Hereâ€™s the RSVP link: [https://hues.typeform.com/to/Uu1FSr](https://hues.typeform.com/to/Uu1FSr "https://hues.typeform.com/to/Uu1FSr")

Read on for more details ðŸ‘‡

## Whatâ€™s a Brain Jam?

In our Brain Jams, weâ€™ll be meeting on Zoom to explore a digital tool and crowdsource creative ways to use it in our facilitation. For the first few, weâ€™ll be focusing on virtual facilitation (for obvious reasons).

This round, our Brain Jam will be on [Mural](http://mural.co/), a digital workspace for visual collaboration. Think collaborative whiteboard + markers + sticky notes, but 100% online.

Here is a 90-second video explaining Mural:

## How will the Brain Jam go?

In a Zoom call with a max of 40 participants, weâ€™ll start by briefly reviewing the technology.

Then, in breakout rooms, weâ€™ll use the Liberating Structure process [Wise Crowds](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/13-wise-crowds/) to source problems and brainstorm creative ways to use the technology to solve them.

Weâ€™ll finish by coming back to the large group and sharing highlights from the breakouts with everyone, so we all leave with new creative ideas to enhance our digital facilitation.

## Whoâ€™s invited?

All facilitators are invited to the Brain Jam. As space is limited, we will be prioritizing our [Kickstarter backers](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/facilitatorcards/facilitator-cards) and then opening the unclaimed spots to our wider Facilitator Cards community. These spots will be allocated first-come, first-serve.

## When are they happening?

We will be hosting two different Mural Brain Jams:

* May 15 at 9am PDT / 11am CDT / 12pm EDT / 5pm BST
* May 19 at 4pm PDT / 6pm CDT / 7pm EDT / (May 20) 9am AEST

Both will last 90 minutes. Both will be focused on Mural. And youâ€™re welcome to attend both (the wisdom of each crowd will lead to a unique experience), one, or neither â€” and feel free to invite your facilitator friends & colleagues.

## What do I need in order to participate?

Youâ€™ll need three things:

1. The ability to log-in to a Zoom call (video is a plus, audio is a must).
2. A Mural account if you donâ€™t have one already (they have a 30-day free trial).
3. A commitment that youâ€™ll explore Mural a little before the meeting (weâ€™ll walk you through this in the RSVP form).

This event is free, so no worries about registration fees or tuition.

## Where are the meeting details?

Youâ€™ll find the meeting details at the end of the [RSVP](https://hues.typeform.com/to/Uu1FSr). Please feel free to email me at meg@facilitator.cards with any additional questions.

I canâ€™t wait to jam with yâ€™all!

P.S. We are not affiliated with or sponsored by Mural or Zoom. We simply think they're neat tools that can help us enhance and adjust our practices in this [digital facilitation moment](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/modifying-in-person-activities-for-virtual-facilitation/).
