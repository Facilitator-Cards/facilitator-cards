In the wake of COVID-19, many of us have found ourselves thrust into a world of virtual facilitation for the first time. Weâ€™re having to put down many of the tools we know and love that donâ€™t translate into this new virtual space. As facilitators, we want to keep our groups engaged and our processes dynamic, but we need to find [new tools and new ways](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/modifying-in-person-activities-for-virtual-facilitation/) to adapt to make that happen.

To support our community in getting creative and inventive using new technologies, weâ€™re kicking off a virtual facilitation tips series weâ€™re calling Facilitator Brain Jams, this Friday, May 15th! Our first topic will be **Using Mural for Virtual Facilitation.**

With a second session on May 19th (20th if youâ€™re in AEST) on the same topic to make it easier for folks in different time zones to join.

Hereâ€™s the RSVP link: [https://hues.typeform.com/to/Uu1FSr](https://hues.typeform.com/to/Uu1FSr "https://hues.typeform.com/to/Uu1FSr")

## Whatâ€™s a Brain Jam?

In our Brain Jams, weâ€™ll be meeting on Zoom to explore a digital tool and crowdsource creative ways to use it in our facilitation. For the first few, weâ€™ll be focusing on virtual facilitation (for obvious reasons).

This round, our Brain Jam will be on [Mural](http://mural.co/), a digital workspace for visual collaboration. Think collaborative whiteboard + markers + sticky notes, but 100% online.

Here is a 90-second video explaining Mural:
