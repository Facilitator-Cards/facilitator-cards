It's officially giving season! For our fellow facilitators, we wanted to put together & share a few of our favorite things when it comes to facilitation.

We use most of the items below all the time or have heard incredible things about the ones we don't!

## What We Recommend

#### [FACILITATOR CARDS](https://shop.facilitator.cards/products/facilitator-cards?utm_campaign=Shop%20Now&utm_medium=nav&utm_source=fc) ($74.99)

Put simply, these are our favorite tool for facilitators â€” new or seasoned. We use them to plan every single session we run and they are beloved thousands of facilitators in 25+ countries! Our favorite cards we've ever created ðŸ˜‰.

### [FACILITATOR HAT](https://shop.facilitator.cards/collections/merch/products/facilitator-hat) ($29.00)

Put your facilitator hat on! We make this joke all the time, so we finally made the hat. They're comfy, they're made to order, and they are a physical version of an inside joke. Know who your people are immediately â€” anybody who likes this hat is a facilitator.

### [BODY PARTS DEBRIEF](https://www.trainingwheelsgear.com/products/body-part-deluxe) ($34.99)

One of our all-time favorite ways to wrap up an in-person event. Have people connect their body to their mind while having something squishy to hold (oddly enough, that makes people more likely to share!).

### [WE! CONNECT CARDS](https://weand.me/product/we-connect-cards/) ($25.00)

Brilliant icebreaker questions for when you're feeling uncreative and really cool/subtle ways to get to know who is in the room. One of our favorite kick-offs to in-person events is handing out these cards and doing a few question slots.

### [CLIMER CARDS](https://climercards.com/buy-now/) ($25.00)

Asking people to share how they're feeling & thinking through a visual metaphor invites people to share more freely and often gets the people who are hesitant to share to open up to the group. Plus! They come with a virtual version for use online.

### [FACILITATORGEAR.COM]() (prices vary)

[Facilitatorgear.com](http://facilitatorgear.com/) is a new website that our leader Meg helped launch recently. It's where Facilitator Geeks get to review facilitator gear â€“ like card decks! Check out all the options & insightful reviews over on faciliatatorgear.com!

### [CATCHBOX]() ($449)

Catchbox is a microphone you can literally throw around the audience to hear back from your participants (throw me the mic!). We've never been more excited about a microphone and it's been a classic all these years for a reason.

### SERIOUS PLAY SETS BY LEGO (kits range from $36.99 to $789.99)

Who says you have to grow up? Because it sure isn't LEGO! These perfect little pouches to hand out to participants so they can build & create with LEGO. Taking visual metaphors and externalizing your ideas to a whole new level.

We hope you've gotten some ideas or items! Wishing everyone a wonderful holiday season.
