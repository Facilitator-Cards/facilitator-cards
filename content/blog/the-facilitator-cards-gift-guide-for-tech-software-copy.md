It's officially giving season! For our fellow facilitators, we wanted to put together & share a few of our favorite technology/software things. These are awesome items or subscriptions to gift a fellow facilitator (or hey, add them to your wishlist!). 

We use and love all of the items recommended below!

## What We Recommend

#### [STREAMDECK](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck) ($149.99)

Stream Deck makes it possible to easily switch & manage things in OBS (no more screen-shares!), queue up all the text I want to send in the chat, and manage multiple timers. I won't facilitate another virtual workshop without it!

### [EPOCCAM](https://www.elgato.com/en/epoccam) ($7.99)

Turns your iPhone into a webcam! Instantly use one of the best cameras in your house as a webcam. Our favorite use for it? Have it above your desk and point it down for the perfect desk overhead shot â€“ without having to buy a separate camera.

### [AHASLIDES](https://ahaslides.com/v1/) (Plans range from Free to $15.95)

Our favorite way to get responses from large groups of people and share them back in live time. It's live polling software that is so fast and easy to use you can make slides mid-facilitation which allows for incredible flexibility!

### [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Free!)

The best _free_ software! Give yourself the gift of a free tool that will change every session you run. Never screen share again! Keep people engaged with your face and information while you switch between multiple camera views with ease.

### [CONVERTKIT](https://convertkit.com/) (Plans range from Free to $25.00)

Makes it quick & easy to draft and send an email (much faster than Mail Chimp!) while also providing beautiful ways to automate sequences of emails and create excellent landing pages for specific events, products, or resources.

### [LU.MA](https://lu.ma/) (Plans range from Free to $39.00)

An elegant & easy platform to use for event registration. Our favorite feature? Lu.ma will tell participants what time the event is in their local time on the event page. Free for free events, paid for paid events. And hey, they've even got a tip jar feature!

### [MOSSY EARTH](https://www.mossy.earth/) ($12.50/month)

If you travel, shop online, or use electricity you create a carbon footprint. Mossy Earth is our favorite partner to do eco-restoration and plant native trees around the world to help lower our carbon impact. Also makes an excellent gift for anyone who travels frequently, even if they're not a facilitator!

### [AIRTABLE](https://airtable.com/invite/r/SfqPiwTs) (Plans range from Free to $24.00)

An incredible way to make databases of participants, automate data entry, and a more professional, flexible (and beautiful) replacement for any Google Form. Really cool interactive features and limitless creativity. And the free version is boss! 

(*Affiliate link provided, if you use our link to sign-up it's totally free for you & Airtable sends us $10.)

We hope you've gotten some ideas or items! Wishing everyone a wonderful holiday season.
