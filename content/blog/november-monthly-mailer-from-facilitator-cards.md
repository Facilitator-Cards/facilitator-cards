## 🌤 November **Monthly Mailer from Facilitator Cards**

Well howdy facilitators, welcome to November! Did you know there are only 8 weeks left in the year? Oh you didn’t? Oh you didn’t want to know that…moving on!

We’ve got quite a bit coming up this month, so let’s get into it.

## **📆 Trainings Coming Up This Month!**

### 🧑‍🏫 [**Holding Space: Generous approaches to problematic statements and conflict**](https://lu.ma/holdingspacenov) **- November 14 @ 3PM ET — $49**

If you hate feeling caught off guard when someone says something problematic or conflict-inducing in the groups you lead — [this is the session for you](https://lu.ma/holdingspacenov)!

There are so many moves we can make as facilitators to help diffuse those moments, unpack ideas, and reconnect the group after being thrown off course.

**Join us for a 90-minute session to learn what those moves are and feel ready the next time conflict arises.**

### 🚨 [Navigating Triggers As Facilitators](https://lu.ma/triggersworkshop) - November 29 @ 1PM ET - $49

As facilitators, we're in a uniquely tricky position being responsible for holding the space for the emotional well-being of a group while having our own emotions and realities to navigate. But what happens when **we** get triggered during a session?

What options do we have, how do we handle it, and what can we do even **before** the event begins that can help us steer through triggers that pop up unexpectedly?

**That’s what this event is all about! Strategies for how we can navigate our triggers as facilitators.**
