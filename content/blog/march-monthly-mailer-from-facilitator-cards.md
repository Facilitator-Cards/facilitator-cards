Hey Facilitators,

Whoa, it’s already March! (Did February feel _extra_ quick this year or is that just us?)

We’ve got two awesome events coming up this month, some new Zoom tips, and a new Card Of The Month for ya already!

## 🗓 [Events This Month](https://lu.ma/facilitatorcardscal)

### 🤲 [Holding Space: Generous approaches to problematic statements and conflict](https://lu.ma/holdingspacemar) - March 21 @ 1 - 2:30pm ET

When we gather a group to learn, share, or work together there is always a risk that something decisive or problematic will be said. Even small things can create a riff or unease that can linger in the group, and how we respond as facilitators or leaders in those moments makes all the difference.

**This session is about understanding how we can move a group through divisive moments and come out together on the other side successfully.**

We’ll explore:

* How mindsets unconsciously shape our strategies as facilitators
* Ways to cultivate generosity and curiosity (even in moments of conflict)
* The order of operations to use when addressing challenging comments

_“Powerful way to approach difficult situations in a new and refreshing way. Loved how tangible the tools are!_”

_“Amazing how helpful a short workshop can be in finding strategies for something so anxiety-inducing!”_

## 🗓 [Future Events](https://lu.ma/facilitatorcardscal)

### 🚨 [Navigating Triggers](https://lu.ma/fctriggers) - April 20th @ 1 - 2:30 ET

As facilitators, educators, leaders, or coaches, we have a unique responsibility to our groups to stay calm and centered during our sessions—no matter what may come our way.

This workshop is all about how we can remain present in moments of conflict and what strategies can best help us navigate those events.

Attendees will learn:

* A step-by-step breakdown of what happens when you get triggered
* Mindsets you can prepare before you get in the room to help avoid potential triggers
* Strategies to use when you are triggered to help you return to a centered space

## **📸 From the Insta!**

Zoom, zoom, zoom! We’ve decided that 2023 is the year we’re no longer accepting bad Zoom workshops. Virtual sessions are here to stay and with small tweaks and changes can transform from “just another Zoom call” to sessions that keep people active & engaged throughout.

Looking to have your slides show up in **your** Zoom window newscaster-style? Check out [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or [mmhmm](https://www.mmhmm.app/home)! (We use OBS in our sessions, but it can definitely take some time to get the hang of! Mmhmm is a handy alternative that we’ve found is a lot easier to get the hang of straight away.)

## **🃏Card Of The Month: Anonymous Q&A**

Getting honest questions leads to a better answer!

[Anonymous Q&A](https://www.facilitator.cards/cards/anonymous-qa/) is a powerful clarifying process that we use in both virtual and in-person sessions. By collecting questions from participants anonymously we increase participation and get the questions people **really** want answers to.

### When To Use

This framework is helpful in **_so many_** situations.

It’s great for when your participants might be hesitant to say their questions aloud. Whether that’s because it’s a work meeting where admitting to not knowing something would be a vulnerable situation, they have a question that they aren’t sure how to word, or any situation where it would be uncomfortable.

For panels where audience members are submitting questions, Anonymous Q&A allows the moderators to filter out “questions” that are more statements in disguise.

If you’re running a cohort or multi-day sessions, running an Anonymous Q&A can help you shape future session agendas based on what your participants are curious about.

In terms of where we place it in our agenda, we’re big fans of collecting questions right before a break! This gives you some time to filter through the questions and think through your responses without an audience.

When it comes to answering questions, we limit it to around 10 minutes. Even when the questions are interesting, participants’ attention starts to wane. Something we’ve done recently is [filming our answers to some questions we weren’t able to answer during the session](https://youtu.be/_e3OfQ2DrcY) and send the video in our follow-up!

### How We Do It

The simplest way to do Anonymous Q&A is to pass out index cards to participants, have them write their answers (and to keep it truly anonymous, we request that everyone write **something** even if it’s “I don’t have a question”), and collect them. Pro tip: ask participants to flip the card over without folding it when they’re done writing. Save yourself some time—the seconds opening up the cards add up!

When we run Anonymous Q&A during virtual sessions we have a few options:

🧾 [Have participants submit a Google Form](https://virtual.facilitator.cards/anonymous-qa-on-zoom-using-google-forms-meg-bolger)

🛝 Gather questions on [Google Slides](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6386827?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)

📊 Set up a question poll on [AhaSlides](https://ahaslides.com/)* or [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/blog/stand-out-get-ahead/how-to-create-open-ended-questions)

💨 Create a form on [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)

\*A bonus of gathering questions on software like AhaSlides is that other participants can upvote questions to give you a better sense of what your group is most curious about!

### Why We 💛 It

The power of anonymity is not to be underestimated. Whether your participants are students who might be embarrassed to ask questions in front of their friends, co-workers who don’t want to say the wrong thing in a professional development seminar, or participants who don’t want to speak in front of a large crowd, Anonymous Q&A has got their back!

There are so many situations where it becomes high risk to admit when we don’t know something. Anonymous Q&A is a process that provides simple psychological safety.

That’ll be all for March’s mailer! We hope you have a joyful and productive month wherever you are in the world.

Until next time, happy facilitating!
