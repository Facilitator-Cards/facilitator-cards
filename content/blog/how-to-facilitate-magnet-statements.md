"Set up the space for easy movement. Prime the group with a topic or concept, and ask for one participant to make a related statement they believe. Other participants respond by moving closer or farther based on their agreement or disagreement. Ask for another statement, then repeat."

That's the short explanation on the back of [Magnet Statements](https://www.facilitator.cards/cards/magnet-statements/), one of the cards in our [Facilitator Cards Preview Pack](https://www.facilitator.cards/preview-pack "Facilitator Cards Preview Pack") and [the forthcoming foundational deck](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/facilitatorcards/facilitator-cards "Facilitator cards on Kickstarter"). 

For those of you who have never participated in a Magnet Statements process, that explanation might leave a bit to be desired. Allow me to help!

Following is a full walkthrough of how to facilitate the Magnet Statements activity, followed by explanation of why we categorize it how we did (as Full Group configuration, and for facilitating Emotion). Then I'll give you some ideas for different ways you can use Magnet Statements, highlight its unique strengths, and give you some suggestions for other Facilitator Cards this process plays nicely with.
