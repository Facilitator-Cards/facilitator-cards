## 🏖 **July Monthly Mailer from Facilitator Cards**

What’s up Facilitators,

Oh hey it’s already July! (Congratulations to everyone for making it through June, you did it, you survived!)

We’ve been shaking things up here at Facilitator Cards these last few weeks finding new focuses, honing new routines and systems, and continuing our efforts to make the world a better more communicative place through facilitation education.

We’ve got some things to share about last month plus we want to let you in on what we’re getting up to in July!

## **📆 Events Coming Up This Month!**

### **🦈** [**Become a Card Shark**](https://lu.ma/cardsharks) **- Wednesday, July 20 @ 4-5pm ET**

Card Sharks is the session designed to help you get the most out of your deck of Facilitator Cards. In this 60-minute session, you will:

1. Learn new cards and combinations you can easily implement in your next workshop
2. Figure out how to find the cards you need (and not get overwhelmed by the rest!)
3. Work through real-life scenarios to figure out a plan with your Facilitator Cards

Admission is included with your deck, you’ll meet other wonderful facilitators in our community, and if you’ve got your deck of Facilitator Cards then you can [RSVP right now](https://lu.ma/cardsharks)!

_And if you don’t have a deck yet, if you order them **today** they will likely arrive in time for this month's Card Sharks! Use code CARDSHARK for 10% off your deck._

## **📸 From the Insta**

We took intentionally pared down our social media usage in June, so we wanted to highlight some of our best virtual tips from the last few months!

💬 [Three creative ways to use the Zoom Chat](https://www.instagram.com/p/CbP2UUELuvo/)

⌛️ [Intentional Slow Starts](https://www.instagram.com/p/CdqUapUrHL2/) (and how they can transform the rest of your session)

## **👀 In Case You Missed It - Event Replays**

### 🙋 [What are Facilitator Cards REPLAY](https://youtu.be/FoeDBmF61x0)

Facilitator Cards are sometimes a tricky thing to explain to people but they aren’t difficult to experience (as a participant) or to use (as a facilitator). So rather than TELL people about Facilitator Cards, last month we ran an event all about getting to experience them from both the participants’ side and the facilitators. It was a great success!

If you’ve been curious about Facilitator Cards OR you are looking to feel re-energized about creative ways to use the cards, [check out this recording](https://youtu.be/FoeDBmF61x0)! In the first 15 minutes alone you’ll see us facilitate 5 different cards that are easy to implement in any online facilitation.

### 😡 [But You’re Wrong Event REPLAY](https://youtu.be/9OpgSusIGlE)

Last month Meg facilitated a session called But You’re Wrong which is all about how to navigate disagreements, whether that’s in sessions with participants or out in the rest of the world. If you find yourself having a hard time not dismissing some of your participants or reaching those who might have a different set of views or value to you, you might be interested in [checking out this event recording](https://youtu.be/9OpgSusIGlE).

### 🦈 [June Card Sharks REPLAY](https://youtu.be/x6rnpnNHc1Q)

Every month we get together as a Facilitator Cards community to get to know our cards and use them to brainstorm ideas for common facilitation scenarios. Last month we had a great session and if you missed it, check out [the video](https://youtu.be/x6rnpnNHc1Q)! Following along with this video is a great option if you can’t make it to a live Card Shark session (or want a preview of what to expect when you come!).

### 🧑‍💻 [Master Your Virtual Meetings](https://youtu.be/FlOdpzAidfA)

When people ask us, “How do I facilitate a smoother virtual facilitation? What tech do you use that helps you?” this video is our answer.

### 🧰 [Never Facilitate Online Without This](https://youtu.be/uu9zbZkIKcI)

Stream Deck is the piece of hardware that has most transformed our virtual facilitations (and honestly all of our work in general) in the last two years. It’s a powerful piece of tech and in this video we share all the ways it can be your digital co-facilitator for online sessions.

### 🪄 [How to Stop Screen Sharing and Make Zoom Magic Happen with OBS](https://youtu.be/wW1E4PtDz9k)

If Stream Deck is the hardware that’s made the most difference to our virtual facilitations, OBS is the software. It has helped eliminate screen shares almost entirely by allowing us to simply bring slides or anything else that we want to share with our participants directly in the Zoom window. [This video](https://youtu.be/wW1E4PtDz9k) will show you all the magic and point you to where to get started.

### 😰 [How to Deal With Drop-off with Breakout Rooms](https://youtu.be/6h787c--0WQ)

Have you ever put people into breakout rooms in a session only to have a bunch of people stranded without anyone to talk to because people dropped out of the session after you assigned the rooms? Here are a few hacks for that exact scenario.

**Bonus Video from our friend Chad Littlefield**

Chad shared [a video all about why it’s important to stop asking, “Does anyone have any questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP0rvhHuihA),” at the end of a session and what to do instead. We thought the quick brainstorming exercise he suggested was genius and wanted to share it with you!

\**

Alrighty then, that is going to do it for this month. Thanks for being part of our community, take care of yourselves, and until next time happy facilitating!
