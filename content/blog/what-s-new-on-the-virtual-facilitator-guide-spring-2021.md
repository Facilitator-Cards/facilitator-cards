+++
The Virtual Facilitator Guide was started as a way to support folks using [Facilitator Cards](http://facilitator.cards/) to transition and translate these cards to Zoom and the online space. Every activity on the virtual guide write-up includes the gist of the activity, a step-by-step walk-through, context you might need as a facilitator, how to swap in/out other tech platforms, and any prep you‚Äôll need to do beforehand.

This round we‚Äôve added new write-ups for a few cards that deal with questions, some of our favorite facilitator cards to facilitate on Gather, and a bonus process that you can add to your deck via the blank emotion card.

### [Anonymous Q&A Two Ways](https://virtual.facilitator.cards/processes/anonymous-q-a)

Giving participants a way to ask you anonymous questions is a go-to facilitator process. We‚Äôve added how to do Anonymous Q&A just on Zoom (with a cool hack using the Change Name feature) and how to facilitate Anonymous Q&A on Zoom using Google Slides. If you‚Äôre someone who uses Google Slides for your decks, this is a perfect way to add a bit of interaction to your presentation without needing to incorporate a new technology.

### [Two Activities That are Dreamy When Using Gather](https://virtual.facilitator.cards/apps/gather)

[Gather.town](http://gather.town/) is a virtual conferencing platform that feels like you‚Äôre inside of a video game. In a past Brain Jam, we explored how facilitators can use Gather‚Äôs virtual world to breathe new life into online trainings ([check out what we learned here](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/using-gather-for-virtual-facilitation-canning-the-brain-jam/)). There are a few activities that work so well on Gather that were just added to the guide.

[Gallery Exhibit](https://virtual.facilitator.cards/gallery-exhibit-on-zoom-using-gather-meg-bolger) using Gather is so fun‚Äîyou walk around a ‚Äúroom‚Äù and get to interact with documents, images, even interactive links in a novel way. While there is an interesting way to hack a [Gallery Exhibit on Google Slides](https://virtual.facilitator.cards/gallery-exhibit-on-zoom-using-google-slides-meg-bolger), on Gather this activity feels so much more like the in-person experience.

[Spectrum Questions](https://virtual.facilitator.cards/spectrum-questions-on-zoom-using-gather-meg-bolger) is an old favorite of mine. Facilitating it on Gather was one of the first things that made me realizeGather can recreate in-person experiences in a powerful way. I‚Äôve used this activity a few times, and participants are always so amused by how lifelike it is.

### [No Cross-talk Shares: A New Card for Your Deck](https://virtual.facilitator.cards/no-cross-talk-shares-on-zoom-meg-bolger)

In every deck of [Facilitator Cards](http://facilitator.cards/) there are four blank cards purposefully included so that you can write in your favorite activities or new activities that you learn along the way. One of my favorite emotion cards that you can add to your deck is [No Cross-talk Shares](https://virtual.facilitator.cards/no-cross-talk-shares-on-zoom-meg-bolger).
