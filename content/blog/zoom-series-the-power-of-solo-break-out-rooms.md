When it comes to virtual sessions it can be hard to replicate the moments of transition between topics and processes. Every main room on Zoom looks the same so creating separation can really help participants get into a new headspace.

We’re big fans of having folks turn their cameras off in the main room if we’re running a [Fishbowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5Mu3wxybpA) or a [Minute Paper](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/february-card-of-the-month-minute-papers/), but we’ve recently discovered the power of **solo breakout rooms.**

Solo breakouts allow participants to feel like they’re in a space of their own. We’ve found that some participants like to be able to play music for themselves, feel more accountable with their camera on without having to be in front of an audience, and the timer sets a hard cut-off for participants who like being able to work right up to time without the need to pay attention to the clock.

In regards to increasing participation during a session, we always like to remember that participation doesn’t always have to be speaking aloud to the whole group. Activities like [Silent Reflection ](https://www.facilitator.cards/cards/silent-reflection/)are a great way to make sure that everyone participates and engages with the activity.

Giving participants a moment to collect their thoughts and write things down without the pressure of sharing right away will also increase the quality of their responses.

Remember before sending them off to remind them:

* what the prompt is—we like to always put it in the chat for permanent reference
* how long they’ll have
* if they’ll be sharing their responses or using the activity purely for their own reflection

Keeping virtual sessions engaging can prove challenging when we can’t energetically shift the same way as we can when in the same room with our groups. By varying their screen settings we can help create a definitive transition and help usher in a fresh headspace!
