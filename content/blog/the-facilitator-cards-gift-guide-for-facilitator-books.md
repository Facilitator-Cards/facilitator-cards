It's officially giving season! For our fellow facilitators, we wanted to put together & share a few of our favorite books when it comes to facilitation and the facilitator mindset.

We will be linking to the books GoodReads page, and encourage everyone to support their local independent bookstore this holiday season!

If you want to get them shipped, check out these sites for used books:

We hope you've gotten some ideas or items! Wishing everyone a wonderful holiday season.
