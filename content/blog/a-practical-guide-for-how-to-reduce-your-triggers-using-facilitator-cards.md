At the Brain Jam last week we talked about understanding what happens when we get triggered, different strategies we can use in those moments to come back to being present, and how having plug-and-play strategies can be key to creating calm in those instances.  
  
If you missed the Brain Jam and are curious about what happens when you’re triggered and strategies for navigating it we’ve got two offerings.

The first is to watch the jam!

The second is to read Ch. 9 of Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation called Triggers which you can download here: [https://www.facilitating.xyz/chapter-9-unlocking-the-magic-of-facilitation-triggers/](https://www.facilitating.xyz/chapter-9-unlocking-the-magic-of-facilitation-triggers/ "https://www.facilitating.xyz/chapter-9-unlocking-the-magic-of-facilitation-triggers/")

Read on to learn about how using Facilitator Cards to plan your sessions can help you navigate your triggers and a special part two to our event!

## Bite-size information is really helpful when you get overwhelmed.

Preparing for a session is key, but when your agenda is a full-page written out on your Google Drive, it doesn’t feel all that helpful when you’re trying to quickly pivot or buying yourself a little bit of time to move through the moment.

Having physical Facilitator Cards laid out in front of you provides comfort, grounds your agenda, and is immediately adjustable, so you can reflexively respond and switch things up as you need.

## Have backup options for when you are triggered.

Facilitator Cards make Plan-B’s super simple. \[link to pro-tip about plan b’s\] You don’t have to think creatively in a pinch, once you have your backup stack, you just need to pick a card!

## Getting back to baseline

Every Facilitator Card has a key up at the top of the card to identify if the process should be run in pairs, small groups, full groups, or individually. When you need to create an instant plan to find peace, look for the individual or pairs icon up at the top!

\[insert pic with two different cards, circle the individual and pairs icons\]

Say you planned to do Spectrum Questions, swap it out for Pair & Share, Minute Papers, or Declarative Statements to give yourself the space to get back to baseline while your participants can remain engaged without your guidance.

## Plug-And-Play

If you know going into a session that there is a high chance of being triggered, one of our best tips to prepare is to create a go-to backup sequence. You can have a generic one (that you could use in any circumstance) or you could have a specific one for specific triggers that pop up.

A sequence that might work in lots of circumstances would be:

\[this will be a flowchart/picture format\] \[Minute Papers then Pair & Share then I Know vs I Wonder\]

Have your participants journal for one minutes about how they are feeling, pair share their thoughts on what’s happened so far (or on a specific moment of time if you think the group was triggered too) and then finish up with an I Know vs. I Wonder list.

## Building Back Up Plans (Together)

We think that the plug-and-play option is so crucial that we are running an exclusive event for our Facilitator Cards Card Carriers in December to craft sequences together! We will work through scenarios and build out specific sequences for those moments so that you can have a go-to plan ready to go.

We’ll talk strategy, share our best practices, and work through different scenarios and the cards that can help us easily navigate through them.

If you don’t feel like you encounter being triggered when you facilitate, if you are someone who encounters similar challenging moments over and over again during facilitations, this event will be great for you too! Whether it’s a participant who keeps taking over a meeting, pulling rank in a conversation, or when someone disagrees with the agenda, we’ll be able to come up with a specific strategy for that moment together.
