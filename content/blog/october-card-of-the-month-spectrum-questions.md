_Each month, we highlight a card in every newsletter so you can get to know_ [_the deck_](http://shop.facilitator.cards) _one at a time. This month, allow us to introduce you to one of our favorite ways to get a gauge on what the group is thinking: Spectrum Questions!_

### Here’s how to do it

Set up a spectrum. In-person we do this by making a large, easily move-about-able space in the middle of the room.

For virtual Spectrum Questions there are a few options:

* Use software with a spacial canvass like Gather.Town so you can more closely recreate the feeling of physical movement
* Set up a spectrum on a digital whiteboard (if the software you’re using has one built in, awesome!), and have everyone stamp or put a sticky where they fall

[(For more on virtual, check out this video detailing how we set up Spectrum Questions in Mural!)](https://youtu.be/VU8t2L-YDhk?t=684)

Once you’ve got your spectrum set up, read the prompt, and have folks move to their corresponding spot on the spectrum. Have everyone take a look around and notice where other people are.

Once they’re on the spectrum, you as the facilitator have a few options. You can immediately read the next prompt, pair folks who are nearby each other for a debrief, or ask if anyone wants to share why they placed themselves where they did.

We find the debrief necessary whenever a prompt has brought up a lot of emotions—or if it’s about a topic that people will feel compelled to speak about. It’s also easy to invite specific people to respond because they’ve already made a statement about where they fall and you’re just asking them to expand their ideas.

### When it’s useful

Whenever there’s a variety of feelings regarding different topics, ideas, experiences, etc. Spectrum Questions is a great way to have the whole group show rather than tell!

It’s an efficient way to get an immediate read on your group's perspective, which makes it ideal when you want to find a starting place for deeper exploration in the conversation.

We also find it really helpful when people are not speaking from their own position, but bringing in an imagined perspective (”Devil's advocate” vibes). Run Spectrum Questions to have people solidify _their_ position.

It’s also an easy way to break up the monotony of sitting in one place for too long. It doesn’t have to be a long activity to be impactful!

### Prompt Pro Tip

You can always change up the spectrum on which people are answering, so you can always tailor the activity to whatever information you’re getting from the group.

* Agree ←→ disagree
* Excited ←→ Anxious
* 1 ←→ 10
* Always ←→ Never
* Very Important ←→ Not Important

When it comes to Spectrum Questions, the Question part is referring to the question of where people will fall on the spectrum. The prompts themselves are best phrased as evocative statements. No yes or no’s here!

**Getting a sense of the entire group (strongly agree <—> strongly disagree)**

“Feeling confident as a student leader is important to me.”
