This page is a resource for the event Navigating Triggers as a Facilitator. We're excited you want to learn more and please let us know if there is anything you were expecting to find here but you don't see.

## Part 2: Navigating Triggers with Facilitator Cards

We're going to be doing a follow-up to this event where we'll discuss and build plug-and-play strategies that you can use when you or your participants are feeling triggered to help move through those moments. This event will be highly facilitated, self and small group work, and a more spacious agenda.

**RSVP for part 2 event here:** [**https://lu.ma/dec-fc-exclusive**](https://lu.ma/dec-fc-exclusive "https://lu.ma/dec-fc-exclusive")

This event is offered free for all folks with Facilitator Cards. If you would like to join but don't yet own cards, if you purchase cards before Nov 10 they should have plenty of time to arrive before the event!

## Recording & Slides

Here is the link for the recording of the first hour of the November Brain Jam. [https://youtu.be/zp-dNovI4-A](https://youtu.be/zp-dNovI4-A "https://youtu.be/zp-dNovI4-A")

If you click here you can also watch the [second hour of the Brain Jam](https://youtu.be/VVKz34aeudM). The second hour of the Brain Jam was a free-flowing conversation about triggers, our responsibilities as facilitators, checking in with participants being triggered, and more. Think of this more as a panel podcast on triggers.

## Resources about Triggers

Here is the article from [Dr. Kathy Obear on the Triggering Events Cycle](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/oacs/wp-content/uploads/sites/140/Navigating-Triggers.pdf) if you'd like to read more about Dr. Kathy's model.

Triggering Events Traffic Circle that I shared with you yesterday can also be found in Ch 9 of Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation. You can [download the full book here](facilitationmagic.com) (or buy it where books are sold) or [just download the chapter here](https://www.facilitating.xyz/chapter-9-unlocking-the-magic-of-facilitation-triggers/).![](/img/blog/screen-shot-2021-11-04-at-7-46am.png)

### Navigating Triggers Train-the-Trainer

If you are interested in teaching how to navigate triggers to others using these models you're welcome to use and share all the materials above.

If you would like additional support, resources, and practice before you go live, we're considering running a Train-the-Trainer that would prepare you to run a similar session to this event in your own community.

[**Sign up here if you're interested in a Train-the-Trainer on Navigating Triggers**](https://airtable.com/shrXrbwoqx9lcLXwF). If we have enough interest we'll move forward to scheduling the event!

## More Facilitation Events & Support!

If you're looking for a community of facilitators that you can grow and learn, you've found the right crew.

At Facilitator Cards we're always putting on events and creating resources for facilitators by facilitators. We work with companies and organizations to train up their facilitators (let us know if you want to work together!) and we also host free events and open enrollment sessions throughout the year.

Which you can always find at https://lu.ma/facilitatorcards

### December Intensive

We have a 1-day facilitation intensive coming up in December (registration includes Facilitator Cards!) which is going to be an awesome event all about the art of facilitation, our learning edges as facilitators, and how we can more creatively and quickly build agendas and plans that meet our participants right where they are.

[**Register here for the December Intensive**](https://lu.ma/iwt6zqpq)
