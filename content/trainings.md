## Our philosophies at Facilitator Cards:

* Everyone can learn how to be a facilitator
* When we know what choices we can make as a facilitator, we feel more empowered when it comes to leading and designing meetings, trainings, and workshops
* Learning to facilitate can be quick and fun

Our trainings are designed to do more than just help you figure out how to use Facilitator Cards. They are immersive experiences created to help you understand the fundamentals of facilitation and what choices you get to make as a facilitator, as well as being opportunities to practice honing your instincts as a facilitator.
