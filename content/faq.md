You got questions? We got answers.

### Do the decks come with a marker?

**No.** We know a lot of facilitators are picky about their stationery (we sure are!). So you can use the wet-erase markers you already own, or whatever is sold in stores near you. 

Instead of including a “Facilitator Cards” marker, we spent a lot of time testing tons of different markers and colors, to make sure that regardless of which brand of wet-erase marker you use, it won’t ruin the cards.


### What size are the cards?

Standard playing card size of **3.5” x 2.5”** with rounded corners.


### What’s in the box?

**60 unique Facilitator Cards.** 15 for facilitating emotion, 15 for ideation, 15 for clarification, and 15 for execution. Plus, the box itself has a little key explaining the icons (for group configuration, props, etc.) for your reference.


### What’s included with the deck?

Every order of Facilitator Cards (print or digital) includes **a ton of supporting materials and resources**: including a robust Facilitator Cards Facilitation Guide, an e-book copy of _Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation_, icons you can use for your planning, access to a community of facilitators and more!


### What if I want to order more than 20 decks?

Yay! That’s awesome. Please **contact us** at hello@facilitator.cards and we’ll work together to make that easy. 


### Can I get Facilitator Cards in other languages?

**Not currently.** If we get a lot of interest in a particular translation, it’s definitely something we would consider collaborating on in the future, so [let us know](https://www.facilitator.cards/contact) what languages you’d like to see the cards in).


### Why are they wet-erase-marker compatible (and not dry erase)?

Initially, [our plan was for them to be dry erase](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/testing-and-changing-directions/). But we changed that up after testing because we realized that **dry erase ink rubs off easily with friction**, and we wanted you to be able to stack these cards, shuffle them around, and bring them to and from your facilitations — all with your notes still intact.


### Why are the cards waterproof?

**To make them extra durable!** Whether you’re an outdoor facilitator who regularly works in the rain, or just someone who wants to rinse off the notes you’ve written in the sink (instead of using a damp cloth), you’re good to go.


### Do you offer international (non-USA) shipping?

**Yes!** It’s a little more expensive, but we can ship to most places. 

Here are the places our distribution company **cannot ship to** (sorry, y’all!): Afghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Guam, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar (Burma), North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine.


### Why are you making these if you can print them at home? 

The do-it-yourself Facilitator Cards are great (we’ve been using them for years in our facilitation), but **the decks we’re creating together through Kickstarter are going to knock our socks off**. A deck that will last forever (instead of needing to be remade), that’s waterproof, that is easy to write and erase on, and that just _feels amazing_ to use.


### Can I change my order?

To manage your order (or pledge) **visit the project page and click the “Manage your pledge" button** at the top right. From there you can change payment method, reward selection, pledge amount, even cancel your pledge.
