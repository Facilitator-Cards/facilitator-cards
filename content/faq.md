You got questions? We got answers.

### Do the decks come with a marker?

**If you want!** You can use our [wet-erase markers](https://shop.facilitator.cards/collections/merch/products/wet-erase-markers) or ones you can find at office supply stores (Vis-a-Vis by Expo work great and erase clean).

We made our own markers because we wanted one that was thinner than Expo and erased just as clean. So we made them! 

Now you have the option of having a complete kit the moment you get your Facilitator Cards. Use code PERFECTPAIR [to get our markers for free](https://shop.facilitator.cards/collections/merch/products/wet-erase-markers) with purchase of a deck.

### What size are the cards?

Standard playing card size of **3.5” x 2.5”** with rounded corners.

### What’s in the box?

**60 unique Facilitator Cards.** 15 for facilitating emotion, 15 for ideation, 15 for clarification, and 15 for execution. Plus, the box itself has a little key explaining the icons (for group configuration, props, etc.) for your reference.

### What’s included with the deck?

Every order of Facilitator Cards (print or digital) includes **a ton of supporting materials and resources**: including live Card Shark training to help you get to know your cards, an e-book copy of _Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation_, access to a community of facilitators and more!

### What if I want to order more than 10 decks?

Yay! That’s awesome. Please **contact us** at hello@facilitator.cards and we’ll work together to make that easy and get you the best discount possible.

### Can I get Facilitator Cards in other languages?

**Not currently.** If we get a lot of interest in a particular translation, it’s definitely something we would consider collaborating on in the future, so [let us know](https://www.facilitator.cards/contact) what languages you’d like to see the cards in).

### Why are they wet-erase-marker compatible (and not dry erase)?

Initially, [our plan was for them to be dry erase](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/testing-and-changing-directions/). But we changed that up after testing because we realized that **dry erase ink rubs off easily with friction**, and we wanted you to be able to stack these cards, shuffle them around, and bring them to and from your facilitations — all with your notes still intact.

### Why are the cards waterproof?

**To make them extra durable!** Whether you’re an outdoor facilitator who regularly works in the rain, or just someone who wants to rinse off the notes you’ve written in the sink (instead of using a damp cloth), you’re good to go.

### Do you offer international (non-USA) shipping?

**Yes!** It’s $10 to most anywhere in the world.

Here are the places our distribution company **cannot ship to** (sorry, y’all!): Afghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Guam, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar (Burma), North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine.

### Why are you making these if you can print them at home?

The do-it-yourself Facilitator Cards are great (we’ve been using them for years in our facilitation), but **the decks we've manufactured are beautiful, durable, and reusable**. A deck that will last forever (instead of needing to be remade), that’s waterproof, that is easy to write and erase on, and that just _feels amazing_ to use.

But if you want a print-a-home DIY deck you can [download the PDF deck here](https://facilitatorcards.gumroad.com/l/FCDIY)!
