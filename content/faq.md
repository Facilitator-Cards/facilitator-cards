### What markers should I use with Facilitator Cards?

Facilitator Cards are compatible with **wet-erase markers** (think overhead transparency not whiteboard). We recommend [Facilitator Cards Wet-Erase Markers](https://shop.facilitator.cards/collections/merch/products/wet-erase-markers)! (If you already have a set of Vis-a-Vis by Expo, these work great too and erase clean.)

Plus if you're reading this here's a sneaky treat: use code PERFECTPAIR [to get our markers for free](https://shop.facilitator.cards/collections/merch/products/wet-erase-markers) with the purchase of a deck.

### Why are they wet-erase-marker compatible (and not dry erase)?

Initially, [our plan was for them to be dry erase](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/testing-and-changing-directions/). But we changed that up after testing because we realized that **dry erase ink rubs off easily with friction**, and we wanted you to be able to stack these cards, shuffle them around, and bring them to and from your facilitations — all with your notes still intact.

### What size are the cards?

Standard playing card size of **3.5” x 2.5”** with rounded corners.

### What’s in the box?

**60 unique Facilitator Cards.** 15 for facilitating emotion, 15 for ideation, 15 for clarification, and 15 for execution. Plus, the box itself has a little key explaining the icons (for group configuration, props, etc.) for your reference.

### What’s included with the deck?

Every purchase of Facilitator Cards includes **a ton of supporting materials and resources**: including live getting started training to help you get to know your cards, guides to start implementing your cards, early access to special events and more!

### What if I want to order more than 10 decks?

Yay! That’s awesome. We've got a [bulk request form for you to complete](https://airtable.com/shrCcUtThFlIY1Icy) or if you'd rather feel free to **email us** at hello@facilitator.cards and we’ll get back to you ASAP with a quote and additional info.

### Can I get Facilitator Cards in other languages?

Not currently. :)

### Why are the cards waterproof?

**To make them extra durable!** 

Having plastic cards means you can write your notes directly on the cards and wipe off your notes when you're done to reuse them over and over.

And for our outdoor facilitator friends, you can take the cards with you without worrying they'll get warped by the rain. 

### Do you offer international (non-USA) shipping?

**Yes!** It’s flat-rate of $10 to almost anywhere in the world.

Here are the places our distribution company **cannot ship to** (sorry, y’all!): Afghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Guam, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar (Burma), North Korea, Russia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine.
