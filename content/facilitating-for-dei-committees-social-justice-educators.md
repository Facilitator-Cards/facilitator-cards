title = "Facilitating for DEI Committees and Social Justice Educators"

+++
As advocates, we know how important it is to bring people together to have difficult conversations, and how critical our role is in creating environments that allow people to face, address, and discuss the topic at hand.

Oftentimes, we are passionate about the content of our sessions but less practiced at understanding what processes are best suited to accomplish our goals for that session.

This training is focused on the structures and practices that can contain the messiness of these conversations. We start by understanding the key differences between presenting, teaching, and facilitating groups in conversation. We unpack what we know works and doesn't work for groups in these conversations, and we work through specific scenarios that we regularly encounter as facilitators doing this work.

## **In this training, we will...**

* Unpack the difference between teaching, presenting, and facilitating
* Discuss when in our DEI / SJ work we might want to lean towards teaching, presenting, or facilitating
* Understand the key decision-making points and levers we can use as facilitators to better guide our participants
* Experience and gain familiarity with a range of processes and facilitation methodologies for a variety of scenarios

## **You'll then be able to...**

* Understand how to surface emotions, generate ideas, and make decisions without power dynamics interfering or letting a few people dominate the process
* Encourage discussion, manage debate, and ensure important questions are addressed
* Choose structures that best fit the group's goals
* Create a container for challenging conversations

## **Who's this for?**

This training is for a few different groups of people!

It’s for DEI committees who want to be able to lead impromptu participatory discussions, run internal trainings, or lead meetings around messy conversations.

It’s for Social Justice educators who want to increase the variety of tools they have to lead groups through participatory learning journeys.

It's also for folks who are passionate about social justice and who know that the process of _how_ we move people from A to B is what helps folks take ownership of this information and integrate it into their lives.

## **Details**

This training is best as a full-day course, but can be scaled to a 2-hour or 3.5-hour session upon request. A cohort model is also available.

The full-day training may be in-person, hybrid, or online. All shorter trainings are only available online.

The ideal group size for each training is 8-16 people. Smaller and larger groups can be accommodated upon request.

All participants in every facilitator training will receive a deck of Facilitator Cards and the training always includes how to effectively integrate Facilitator Cards frameworks into their work.
