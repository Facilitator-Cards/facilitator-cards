When you ask people to discuss a challenging topic, brainstorm an idea, or make a collaborative decision, you're asking them to do something difficult. As the leader in that space, your role is to make that easier. But most of us don't know how.

That's what this training is all about.

In this session, we’ll focus on developing your abilities as a facilitator, as well as upskilling your knowledge, tools, and skills to run participatory sessions. We'll examine how to successfully structure sessions, learn to select processes that invite engagement, and practice working through real-life scenarios to build our capacities as facilitators.

## **In this training, we will...**

* Unpack the difference between teaching, presenting, and facilitating
* Understand the key decision-making points and levers we can use as facilitators
* Discuss the When, What, How model to better understand how to level up our abilities as facilitators
* Experience and gain familiarity with a range of processes and facilitation methodologies

## **You'll then be able to...**

* Run highly participatory meetings
* Identify what is best as a presentation and when to shift towards interactive sessions
* Understand how to surface emotions, generate ideas, and make decisions without power dynamics interfering or letting a few people dominate the process
* Encourage discussion, manage debate, and ensure important questions are addressed
* Use meetings to increase camaraderie and create cohesion

## **Who's this for?**

This is for anyone who wants to increase their confidence and abilities to lead participatory sessions, no matter what the topic, group size, or focus. Whether leading them online, hybrid, or in-person, understanding how to facilitate inclusively and effectively makes a world of difference to the culture of every team and organization.

## **Details**

This training is best as a full-day course, but can be scaled to a 2-hour or 3.5-hour session upon request. A cohort model is also available.

The full-day training may be in-person, hybrid, or online. All shorter trainings are only available online.

The ideal group size for each training is 8-16 people. Smaller and larger groups can be accommodated upon request.
