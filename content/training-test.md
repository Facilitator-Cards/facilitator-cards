**Facilitator Training for Managers and Directors** is focused on giving your leadership team the ability to transition from talking at people to talking with people and facilitating their teams talking to each other.

Whether it's meeting with your team or running an all-hands, running effective meetings that make people feel vital, valued, and included is an essential skill as a leader. And yet, it's one that people rarely get any training or support in learning how to do well.

## In this training, we will...

* Understand the decision-making points and choices we have as facilitators in any of our sessions
* Explore & understand the options you have as a leader so you can be intentional in choosing the right method for the moment
* Practice building meeting agendas for common work scenarios including challenging conversations

## You'll then be able to...

* Run highly participatory meetings
* Shift presentations/lectures towards interactive sessions
* Understand how to surface emotions, generate ideas, and make decisions without power dynamics or letting a few people dominate the process
* Encourage discussion, manage debate, and ensure important questions are addressed
* Use meetings to increase comradery and create cohesion

## Who's this for?

This is for organizations who want to increase their leadership's abilities to lead effective gatherings whether that's meetings, onboarding, all-hands, or other sessions. Whether they're leading them online, hybrid, or in-person, understanding how to facilitate a session inclusively and effectively can make a world of difference to the culture of every team and organization.

## Details
