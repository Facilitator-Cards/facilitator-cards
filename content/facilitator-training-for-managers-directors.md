Whether it's meeting with your team or leading an all-hands, running effective meetings that make people feel vital, valued, and included is an essential skill as a leader. And yet it's one that people rarely get any training or support in learning how to do well.

**Facilitator Training for Managers and Directors** is focused on giving your leadership team the ability to transition from talking _at_ people to talking _with_ people and facilitating their teams talking to each other.

## **In this training, we will...**

* Understand how to create an environment that will allow and encourage more participation during meetings
* Practice building meeting agendas and work through specific scenarios, including how to facilitate challenging conversations
* Gain familiarity with different frameworks and methods for brainstorming, decision making, and other common meeting priorities

## **You'll then be able to...**

* Run highly participatory meetings
* Identify what is best as a presentation and when to shift towards interactive sessions
* Understand how to surface emotions, generate ideas, and make decisions without power dynamics interfering
* Encourage discussion, manage debate, and ensure important questions are addressed
* Use meetings to increase camaraderie and create cohesion

## **Who's this for?**

This is for organizations who want to increase their leadership's abilities to lead effective gatherings, whether that's meetings, onboarding, all-hands, or other sessions. Whether they're leading them online, hybrid, or in-person, understanding how to facilitate a session inclusively and effectively can make a world of difference to the culture of every team and organization.
