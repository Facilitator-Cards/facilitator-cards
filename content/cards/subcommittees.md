Break a big idea into smaller parts, and assign each group a different component to discuss. On their own flipchart sheet, ask them to scribe definitions, keywords, or drawings that explain or problem-solve their component. When subcommittees have had enough time to work through their concepts, have each group appoint a spokesperson to share their findings with the full group.
