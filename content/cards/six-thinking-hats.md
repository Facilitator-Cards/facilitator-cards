title: "Six Thinking Hats"
description: "Discuss a plan, problem, idea, or goal in a way that forces everyone to think outside their typical paradigm. Assign \"hats\" to participants that create rules for their shares (e.g., \"white hat = logical, only focusing on data/info;\" \"red hat = emotional, only focusing on feelings,\" \"black hat = pessimistic, pointing out flaws,\" \"yellow hat = optimistic, focusing on possibilities, upsides,\" \"green hat = creative thinking, no suggestion is a bad suggestion,\" \"blue hat = facilitator, focuses on process\"). Change hats periodically."
