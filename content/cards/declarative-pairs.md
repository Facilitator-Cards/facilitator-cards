explanation: "Given a theme or prompt, each partner has a short, set amount of time (e.g., three minutes) to talk uninterrupted, during which they can only make declarative statements. You may choose to limit speakers to start every sentence the same way: \"I believe,\" \"I know,\" \"I am,\" etc. The listening partner can only listen or say things like \"tell me more.\" Swap roles and repeat."
