Given a prompt or question, one partner shares for thirty seconds. The listener then echoes word-for-word, as best they can, what the speaker said. If the echo is satisfactory (the original speaker decides this), swap roles and repeat. If not, the original speaker reiterates and the listener tries again. Repeat with new prompts, new pairs, or both.
