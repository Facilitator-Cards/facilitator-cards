title: Echoed Dialogue
description: One person shares for 30 seconds. The listener then repeats word for word, or as best they can, what the speaker said. If the echo back is satisfactory then the listener can then share for 30 seconds. If not, the original speaker re-iterates, and the listener tries again. Repeat.
