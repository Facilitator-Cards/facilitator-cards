explanation: "Given a prompt or question, one partner shares for 30 seconds. The listener then echoes word-for-word, as best they can, what the speaker said. If the echo is satisfactory (the original speaker decides), the original listener becomes the speaker and shares their response for 30 seconds. If not, the original speaker re-iterates, and the listener tries again. Repeat with new prompts, new pairs, or both."
