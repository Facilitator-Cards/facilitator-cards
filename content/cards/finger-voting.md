On a count of three, have everyone show their vote simultaneously. You can tally the counts for an average, discuss outliers, or keep voting on new options until you reach a consensus."

zooming: "### The Gist

Tell participants you’re going to have them voting on a decision using a number scale. Explain the scale and decision you’re voting on, then ask everyone to type their vote into the Zoom chat, but not hit send until you give them a cue. Cue the votes, then review or discuss the numbers as a whole.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. With a decision in mind that you want group input on, explain to all participants that you’ll be having them vote on a number scale.

2. Clearly explain the scale you’re using. For example, “Vote on a scale from 1 - 10, where 1 means you totally disagree with this plan, and 10 means you wholeheartedly support it.”

3. Instruct everyone not to submit their response until you give them the cue, but to consider their vote then type the number in the Zoom chat box.

4. Check in for questions or clarifications about the instructions. If you’re using a creative or non-intuitive scale (e.g., 1 = watch a movie, 5 = read a book), use this opportunity to suggest what a middle number might represent (does 3 = watch a movie then read a book, or does 3 = neither?).

5. On a countdown from 3, 2, 1, have everyone hit enter and send their votes simultaneously.

6. Review the votes. If there’s general consensus, move on with that decision. If there are just a few outliers, discussing them might clarify the issue. And if people are all over the place, it might be worth going back and ideating different options."
