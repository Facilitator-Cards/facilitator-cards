explanation: "Provide each participant with five sticky notes, then ask a big question or highlight an important sticking point. For example, “What makes a great _____?” Everyone is to write their answer to the question on a sticky note. Keep answers short. Next, have them stick a new note on top and answer \"Why?\" (i.e., Why is that true? Why is that so? Why did you answer that way?). Repeat this process three more times."
