explanation: "Given a central concept, have each group create stickies for each component that comprises it (one per sticky). Then have them arrange the stickies into a diagram by determining what leads to what, using directional arrows (on separate stickies) to represent causality (arrows can go both ways). What happens to the arrows if a component is removed? A new one added?"
