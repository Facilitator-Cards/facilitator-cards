explanation: "Given a central concept, have each group create stickies for every component that is part of it (one per sticky). Then have them arrange the stickies into a diagram by determining what leads to what, using directional arrows on separate stickies to represent causality (arrows can go both ways). What happens to the arrows if a component is removed? If a new one is added?"
