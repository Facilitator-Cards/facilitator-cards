title: "Anonymous Q&A"
description: "Pass out index cards to participants. Let participants know that this is an opportunity for them to ask whatever questions they want to ask. Let everyone know they have to write something on the card, a question, a fact, etc (that way everyone turns in a piece of paper with something written on it). Collect the index cards. Read the question aloud and then answer the questions."
