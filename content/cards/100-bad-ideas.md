explanation: "The epitome of \"no idea is a bad idea.\" Ask the group to generate one hundred (literally, or just as many as you can) ideas, one per sticky note, in response to a prompt or concept. Explain that the ideas can be bad, unpractical, or otherwise worthless. The only rule is that they can\'t repeat ideas. Set a time limit or keep going until you hit your count goal."
