<span class="dropcap seafoam">D</span>o you care about the work I’m doing? Be my boss and you’ll be directly involved in — and responsible for — everything I create, publish, or send out into the world. And it works like any employee/employer relationship:

1. **Pay me a monthly salary.** <br/>You choose the amount ($1 per month minimum), based on
what you think my work is worth, what’s in the budget, or
how much you want to give.
2. **Oversee my day-to-day operations.** <br/>I’ll share regular updates about what I’m working on, what
my plans are, and what’s falling apart.
3. **Weigh in via polls and ideas.** <br/>Let me know what you think I should be working on,
and how I might be able to make you proud. Will I
always follow direction? No. But…
4. **Fire me or give me a raise.** <br/>Am I not up to your caliber? Lay me off. Am I
outperforming your expectations? Give me a raise.
My salary is in your hands.
