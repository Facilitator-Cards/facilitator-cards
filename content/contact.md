## Bulk Orders & Retail

Facilitator Cards are not yet available for retail resale or bulk orders. Check back after a (hopefully!) successful [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/facilitatorcards/facilitator-cards), and we'll have information here for you. Oh, and speaking of which: **we will have a 10-pack option as a Kickstarter backer reward**, so jump on that if you want the best deal.
