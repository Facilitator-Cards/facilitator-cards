## Getting Started Live Training

Every month we run **ü¶à**  Card Sharks which is a live training with Meg, founder of Facilitator Cards, to learn how to put your Facilitator Cards to work! In Card Sharks we cover all the essentials to know about your deck (colors, symbols, etc), how to avoid overwhelm with your cards, and most importantly, how to use your cards to build agendas, create back-up plans, and enhance your facilitations!

No experience or time with your cards is necessary (totally okay to unbox them for the first time with us!)

Card Sharks sessions are always free for Card Carriers, sign up for the next session [here](https://lu.ma/cardsharks)!

**We also host additional trainings every month along with some longer retreats and intensive every few months! All our events are great opportuntiies to connect with other wonderful facilitators from around the world and ways to continue to expand your facilitation toolbox,** To see what we've got coming up [**click here**](https://lu.ma/facilitatorcards)!
